# README-Generator

## Description 

The readme generator makes creating a readme.md file fast and easy. After a simple installation process, the the user initiates the `node index.js` file in their command line and is prompted with questions for filling out each part of the readme document. The motivation to build this came from the desire to make a solid readme template to cover the most important parts of the project.

The readme generator is easy to use, once `node index.js` is run, the user simply needs to answer the questions in relation to their project and click enter. The user is also prompted to enter their email and GitHub username to populate in the question section of the readme. This ensures users can reach out with questions or to collaborate.
